A model file is the blueprint to create and share models with Ollama.

The simplest model file consists of a FROM and SYSTEM instructions:

FROM llama3.1:70b
# sets a custom system message to specify the behavior of the chat assistant
SYSTEM i"""
Your long, shared prompt that is consistent across requests.
"""

To use this:

    Save it as a file (e.g. Modelfile)
    ollama create choose-a-model-name -f <location of the file e.g. ./Modelfile>'
    ollama run choose-a-model-name
    Start using the model!
